            <p>My hobby is reading intresting and knowledgeable books in my free time.Whenever my online classes end,I like to read such books after  completing homework. I'm 11 years old and read in class 6th stanard.Now I know very well that reading is a very good habit which can make me complete.This hobby can developed by anyone.But I got it naturally.Reading books keep one always happy and busy.It is a good source of enjoyment,inspiration,knowledge and instruction.It makes us disiplined,loyal,punctual and most importantly a successfull person in life.</p>
