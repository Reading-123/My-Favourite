        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My hobby is reading intresting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever my online classes end, I like to read such books after completing homework. I'm 11 years old and read in class 6th stanard. Now I know very well that reading is a very good habit which can make me complete. This hobby can developed by anyone. But I got it naturally.Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment, inspiration, knowledge and instruction. It makes us disiplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successfull person in life.</p>

        <h1>My Favourite Books</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My favourite books include adventure,suspense and comedy. Many books like Thea Stilton, Dork Diaries and Harry Potter are in this list. It is very fun to read once you pick the correct genre which you like and suits you. There are my books you can choose for reading, even your school books. And once you find a series you like, you will be eagerly waiting for the next book of the series to be launched. Sometimes for timepass, I re-read my favourite books, but, I will never give them away. School books can be read as a studious genre during mock tests or the main exam. I hav my exams coming up at 7th December, 2020. So my genre has become studious. If I(or anyone else)fit in my(their) head that I will not be addicted to gadgets, reading is a perfect & fun alternative. </p>
